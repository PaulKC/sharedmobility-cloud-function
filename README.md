# Historical Shared Mobility Cloud Functions
This are the cloud functions to import and save the historical data for shared mobility stations based on [Open Data](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/standorte-und-verfugbarkeit-von-shared-mobility-angeboten). The functions are deployed as Cloud Functions in the Google Cloud Platform.
